      </h1>

      <p style={{ marginTop: 16, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.8, opacity: 0.92 }}>
        Petscream didn’t start as a business idea. It started from everyday life
        with animals, and from paying attention to the small moments that often
        get overlooked.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: 14, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.8, opacity: 0.92 }}>
        Over time, we noticed something. Feeding and rewarding pets can easily
        become routine. But when you slow down and care about what goes into
        those moments, they begin to feel different. More intentional. More
        meaningful. Sometimes it’s a treat. Sometimes it’s simply a shared pause
        in the day.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: 14, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.8, opacity: 0.92 }}>
        We believe treats should do more than taste good. Simple, clean
        ingredients and thoughtful choices matter. Not in loud or dramatic ways,
        but in the quiet confidence of giving something you trust.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: 14, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.8, opacity: 0.92 }}>
        Because to us, happiness starts with balance.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: 14, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.8, opacity: 0.92 }}>
        Petscream grew out of this belief. No unnecessary extras. No exaggerated
        claims. Just mindful choices, made with care and respect.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: 14, fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.8, opacity: 0.92 }}>
        We want pets to feel good. Safe. Comfortable. Truly cared for.
      </p>
