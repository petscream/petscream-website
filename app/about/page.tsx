          Petscream didn’t start as a business idea. It started from everyday life with animals,
          and from paying attention to the small moments that often get overlooked.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, we noticed something. Feeding and rewarding pets can easily become routine.
          But when you slow down and care about what goes into those moments, they begin to feel different.
          More intentional. More meaningful. Sometimes it’s a treat. Sometimes it’s simply a shared pause in the day.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe treats should do more than taste good. Simple, clean ingredients and thoughtful choices matter.
          Not in loud ways, but in the quiet confidence of giving something you trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          Petscream grew out of this belief. No unnecessary extras. No exaggerated claims.
          Just mindful choices, made with care and respect.
        </p>
